## Welcome! 

This is a developing collection of open data related exercises for meaningful learning of data skills at the high-school level.

These exercises complement the offer related to [particle physics open data](https://github.com/cms-opendata-education) from the CMS experiment at CERN. 

The material is developed under the coordination of the [Education and open data](https://www.hip.fi/research/education-and-open-data/) project at [Helsinki Institute of Physics](https://www.hip.fi/) and is made possible by a grant from [Finnish National Agency of Education](https://www.oph.fi/en).
