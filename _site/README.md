# About these pages

Github pages are deployed automatically from this repository's master branch. The specific topic pages and their subtopic pages can be found in folders. 

The page layout is defined in [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html), and some values for the navigation are read from [_data/docs.yml](_data/docs.yml).

Pages for different language versions should be placed in subfolders for each language (e.g. folder "en" for the English pages).

To run the site locally on you computer, you can create a local copy of the repository, use Git Bash and follow quickstart instructions on https://jekyllrb.com/
